A framework for violence detection

The insecurity is one of the biggest problems in the world, especially in latin America,  the governments around the world have installed many surveillance cameras but it is very difficult for a person to monitor all the cameras, in this way, the use of artificial intelligence will help enormously. This project started in my master thesis and have two years of developing. Moreover, this project aims to be a framework to store all the state of art in violence detection in video in order to encourage the research on this topic, we are going to applied this software in surveillance camera and hope to reduce the insecurity. Actually, there is nothing compared to that, the majority of research are theorically, but with this framework, we aim to apply it in the real world.

This project aims to be a framework to store all the state of art in violence detection in video or audio, in order to encourage the community to research in this topic, we hope to applied it in surveillance cameras and reduce the insecurity.

A improve to the ViF algorithm is already implemented, but there is a lot of much work to do.
